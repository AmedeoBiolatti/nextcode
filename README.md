# next_code

Native, AI-first IDE written in Rust on [gpui](https://crates.io/crates/gpui).

## Layout

| Crate | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `crates/text` | UI-agnostic rope buffer: edits, undo/redo, grapheme/word motion, UTF-16 mapping, line endings, change log |
| `crates/syntax` | Incremental tree-sitter parsing and highlight spans for C, C++, Python, Rust, SQL |
| `crates/search` | Gitignore-aware project text search with regex, globs and streaming results |
| `crates/watcher` | Debounced project file watching with `.gitignore` filtering |
| `crates/terminal` | Shell process and terminal emulation |
| `crates/ui` | `next_code` binary: editor, docks, LSP, terminal, search, problems and fuzzy file finder (`Ctrl+P`) |

## Build and run

Windows (MSVC Build Tools required), macOS, or Linux:

```sh
cargo run --release -p next_code -- C:\path\to\your\project
```

Replace the example path with an existing project folder. Without an argument, the current directory is opened.

For example, from PowerShell:

```powershell
cargo run --release -p next_code -- C:\dev\next_code
```

Linux additionally needs the gpui system libraries (Wayland/X11, xkbcommon, fontconfig, Vulkan).

## Roadmap

- **M0** editor core: window, file tree, tabs, editing, save, syntax highlighting, fuzzy file finder — *done*
- **M1** LSP (completion, go-to-definition, diagnostics), resizable docks, terminal, project search, Problems panel, external file watching — *done*
- **M2** host agent protocol, WSL
- **M3** git panel and diff view, multiple workspaces
- **M4** AI inline completion, chat, agent
- **M5** devcontainers, debugger (DAP)
- **M6** WASM extension API
